`awesome-devenv` is a hand-crafted list for high-quality development and workflow tools and resources.

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To stay on the list, package repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Functional
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise)
- Stable, or progressing toward stable
- Solves a real problem
